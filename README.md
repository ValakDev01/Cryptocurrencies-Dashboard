# Cryptocurrencies-Dashboard ₿
## Description
✓ Cryptocurrency Dashboard is an advanced Full-Stack project designed to provide real-time tracking and comprehensive data analysis of various cryptocurrencies. Leveraging the power of Express.js, the server fetches essential information by utilizing endpoints, allowing seamless communication with the CoinMarketCap API.

✓ With a focus on efficiency, the application incorporates a clever data caching mechanism to minimize external API queries, optimizing the overall performance and reducing the load on the system.
